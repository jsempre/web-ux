JavaScript operators allow us to perform tests, do math, join strings together, and other such things.

If you haven't already done so, save your code, refresh the page in your browser, and open the developer tools JavaScript console. Then we can try typing in the examples shown below — type in each one from the "Example" columns exactly as shown, pressing Return/Enter after each one, and see what results they return.

First let's look at arithmetic operators, for example:
Operator	Name	Example
+	Addition	6 + 9
-	Subtraction	20 - 15
*	Multiplication	3 * 7
/	Division	10 / 5

You can also use the + operator to join text strings together (in programming, this is called concatenation). Try entering the following lines, one at a time:

let name = 'Bingo';
name;
let hello = ' says hello!';
hello;
let greeting = name + hello;
greeting;

There are also some shortcut operators available, called augmented assignment operators. For example, if you want to simply add a new text string to an existing one and return the result, you could do this:

name += ' says hello!';

When we are running true/false tests (for example inside conditionals — see below) we use comparison operators. For example:

Operator	Name	Example
===	Strict equality (is it exactly the same?)	
5 === 2 + 4 // false
'Chris' === 'Bob' // false
5 === 2 + 3 // true
2 === '2' // false; number versus string
!==	Non-equality (is it not the same?)	
5 !== 2 + 4 // true
'Chris' !== 'Bob' // true
5 !== 2 + 3 // false
2 !== '2' // true; number versus string
<	Less than	
6 < 10 // true
20 < 10 // false
>	Greater than	
6 > 10 // false
20 > 10  // true
